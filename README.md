# todo_app
Simple todo app with express server to add delete and view todos

# To start the project

//Starting the Node.JS express server

1. cd server
2. npm install
3. npm start
4. open new terminal

//Starting react native expo project

6. npm install
5. npm start

//A new tab with chrome will open choose android emulator to open the project.

That all. the app is all yours

# Release note
1. User can add todo. which will be stored into server, and then todo can be seen in todo list.
2. if user clicks on todo item they will be navigated to detailScreen and details will be shown.
3. if user presses on delete button respective todo will be deleted.
4. user can search their todo on the basis of id, title, and body.

any suggestion would help me in improving the code.
